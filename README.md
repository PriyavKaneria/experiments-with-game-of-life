# Experiments with conway's game of life and cellular automata

Check out the live demo [here](https://experiments-with-game-of-life.pages.dev/)

> Root cause (most interesting idea) - Conway's game of life on an N sided plane ([check out 3 sided one](https://experiments-with-game-of-life.pages.dev/isometricgol2D))
